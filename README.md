# VolunteerMatch

This Ruby Gem is my first project for Flatiron Schools Software Engineering Bootcamp.

VolunteerMatch scrapes data, using Nokogiri, from the website Volunteermatch.com. After the user enters a zip code the program will then scrape local volunteer opportunities, and any information related to those opportunities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'VolunteerMatch'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install VolunteerMatch



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).


## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the VolunteerMatch projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/VolunteerMatch/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
